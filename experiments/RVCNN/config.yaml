# Choose number of chunks to divide whole signal into.
# Hessian and gradient are accumulated on chunks. 
# Algorithm step is made on base of accumulated hessian and gradient.
# Whole signal length equals 170800 complex samples.
# It is recommended to set number of chunks such that whole signal length is
# divisible evenly by number of chunks for correct hessian and gradient accumulation.
