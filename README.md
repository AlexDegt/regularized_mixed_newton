## **Steps to reproduce the experiments described in the paper "Mixed Newton Method for Optimization in Complex Spaces"**

- **Positive polynomials minimaiztion**
experiments/positive_polynomial/RMNM_and_ONM_for_positive_polynomial.ipynb contains numerical experiments for the comparison of Ordinary Mixed Newton (ONM) and Regularized Mixed Newton (RMNM) in terms of nonnegative real polynomials minimization.
- **Telecommunication task simulations**

    <li>1. **_Simulations on CV-CNN model:**
        In folder experiments/CVCNN:
        Run run_CMNM.py to reproduce results achieved by Cubic Mixed-Newton method.
        Run run_CNM.py to reproduce results achieved by Cubic Newton method.
        Run run_LM_MNM.py to reproduce results achieved by Mixed-Newton method with Levenberg-Marquardt adaptive regularization control.
        Run run_LM_NM.py to reproduce results achieved by Newton method with Levenberg-Marquardt adaptive regularization control.
        Run plot_results.py to plot corresponding graphs, showed in paper.</li>
    <li>2. **_Simulations on RV-CNN model:_**
        In folder experiments/RVCNN:
        Run run_CNM.py to reproduce results achieved by Cubic Newton method.

- **Abalone task simulations**
    Simulations on both real-valued and complex-valued MLP model:
        In folder experiments/MLP:
        Run run_experiments.ipynb to reproduce simulations related to all optimization methods.
        Run plot_summary.ipynb to plot corresponding graphs, showed in paper.
